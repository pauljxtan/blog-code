# pyqt-image-tagger

A minimal image tagger in Python and Qt for the purposes of this [blog post](https://paultan.ca/blog/pyqt1/).

## Running it

Ensure that you have Python3, [PySide2](https://wiki.qt.io/PySide2), [peewee](http://docs.peewee-orm.com/en/latest/), and [beaker](https://beaker.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) installed. (If you like: `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`.)

Then run `$ python3 run.py`.

[PyQt5](https://www.riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt/intro) can _probably_ be a drop-in replacement for PySide2 but there may be some incompatibilities.
